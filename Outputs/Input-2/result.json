The education score is perfect (100) as the candidate holds a relevant degree and no specific education was required. The weighted total score of 32.84 reflects a poor overall match, primarily driven by the critical gap in Azure platform expertise."

However, the core requirement for this 'Senior Azure Infrastructure Engineer' position is extensive hands-on experience with Microsoft Azure, which is entirely absent from the resume.

This critical gap in Azure-specific skills and services (e.g., AKS, Azure networking, Azure Monitor, Key Vault, Azure AD) significantly impacts his suitability, despite his general DevOps proficiency. While his foundational skills are strong and transferable, the lack of direct Azure expertise makes him a poor fit for a Senior Azure role requiring immediate contribution and deep platform knowledge."

Her resume highlights strong skills in modern web technologies such as React.js, Next.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with basic exposure to CI/CD and Docker. However, the role of a Senior Azure Infrastructure Engineer requires extensive expertise in Azure cloud services, infrastructure engineering, advanced networking, Kubernetes, monitoring, security, and compliance, with a minimum of 4 years in infrastructure engineering and 3+ years hands-on Azure experience. The candidate's profile demonstrates a complete lack of these specific mandatory and preferred skills and relevant experience. Her current experience is entirely in a different domain (frontend web development) and at a much more junior level than required for this senior infrastructure role. Consequently, there is a profound mismatch between the candidate's qualifications and the job requirements, leading to a very low overall match score."

The education score is 100% because the job description has no specific education requirements, and the candidate holds a Bachelor's degree.

However, the Senior Azure Infrastructure Engineer role requires extensive technical expertise in Azure cloud services, infrastructure engineering, networking, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring, and security. The candidate's resume shows no evidence of any of these mandatory or preferred technical skills or relevant experience. His entire professional background is in sales, making him fundamentally unqualified for this highly technical infrastructure role. The only criteria met are the general minimum years of experience and having a degree, but the specific technical experience and skills are entirely absent. This results in a very low overall match score."
